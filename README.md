### why use this tool?

this tool can help with the search for OSINT and GEOINT, initially I wanted to see if it was possible to know certain military positions thanks to the latest Instagram posts posted by soldiers on a war place. This tool can therefore get you the latest posts on a particular subject or specific keyword. AI or knowledge of GEOINT can be coupled with this tool. It can also be used for dataset generation.
